##First Exercise - Visual Dictionary## (30 mins)

	* Mission - Create a visual dictionary of terminology used within the system architecture discipline as a reference point for subsequent exercises
	* Learning Objectives
		* Recognise the main conceptual layers that may exist within an architecture.
		* Explore one layer per group and elucidate 5 terms within
		* 3 ways your layer relates to the other layers explorded by the other groups.

##Second Exercise - Puzzle## (45 mins)
	
	* Mission - apply the recognition gained in exercise 1 to build a testable map of an existing server side architecture from evidence and experimentation.
	* Learning Objectives
		* Interpret multiple oracles of information to determine a previously unarticulated architecture
		* Diagram the architecture using common architectural notations and visual dictionary from the first exercise
		* Assess architectural evidence to show reliability of the oracles in use

##Third Exercise - The Big Picture## (60 mins)

Intro
	
	* Mission - Using the information and skills gained in the last 2 exercises critique a proposed mobile app architecture for risk and testability.
	* Learning Objectives
		* Interpret multiple oracles of information pertaining to the proposed architecture  
		* Identify areas of potential technical and business risk within the proposed architecture
		* Apply the principles of testability to the proposed architecture to enhance the testing effort

Mental model of systems
Conceptualise/abstraction
Not to fill in the gaps - not to answer all the questions
Architecture as truly emergent, iterative.
Levels of detail are really important - whats the simplest thing we can build. Reassess.
Domain Driven Design - bounded contexts - inputs and outputs - might be interesting 
2 levels for 2nd exercise
Risk
-App level risk - resilience
-Business processes and customer risk - most critical things to the business
-Data integrity
-Technology
Background services in the app layer
Wordy paragraphs tend to bias what you take away

In order to properly understand the big picture, everyone should fear becoming mentally clouded and obsessed with one small section of truth.
